OVERVIEW : BLUETOOTH-BASED HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM

Objective:

To design and implement a wireless home automation system that allows a user to control household electrical appliances (like lights or fans) using a smartphone application communicating via Bluetooth with an Arduino or similar microcontroller. The system aims to provide convenient, low-cost remote control for basic home functionalities.

Key Elements:
 
 Bluetooth Module (e.g., HC-05/06) – Establishes wireless communication between the microcontroller and the smartphone                                                                                        Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino UNO/Nano) – Acts as the central processing unit, interpreting Bluetooth commands and controlling the relays.
Relay Module – Serves as an electrically controlled switch to interface the low-voltage microcontroller with the high-voltage AC appliances.
Smartphone Application – A custom or readily available app (like an Android Bluetooth terminal) for sending ON/OFF commands to the system.
Status Feedback – (Optional) An LED or serial monitor output to confirm the command execution or the status of the appliances.

Technology Used:

Arduino UNO/Nano – Microcontroller for processing wireless commands and controlling output devices.
Bluetooth Module (HC-05/06) – Enables serial communication over a short-range wireless link.
Relay Board – Allows safe switching of AC loads using the microcontroller's low-power output.
Smartphone (Android/iOS) – Used to install the control application.
Arduino IDE – Used for writing, compiling, and uploading the control logic to the microcontroller.
